# HAL9000-installer
Installer for https://github.com/juergenpabel/HAL9000

This application features 3 screens (that can be switched to using the shortcuts given in the footer):
- Installer
- Terminal
- Help screen (showing this README)

The Installer screen is used to both install required software and configure the system for running the HAL9000 application (which runs in containers).
